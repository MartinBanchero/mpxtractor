#' Measurements of od600 for a 16x24 micro plate produced by spectraMax reader.
#' The dataset contain the Measurement and other attributes for three different
#' timepoints. The dataset was group by wells and arranged by time. This in
#' order to provide an easy way to use time series. Both datasets
#' df_spectramax_outdata_1 and df_spectramax_outdata_2 have the same structure.
